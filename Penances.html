        <strong>Acts of Contrition for Clerics</strong><br><br>
        This table provides possible acts of penance or contrition for clerics who have strayed from their deity's will, alignment, or teachings. These tasks range from minor acts of humility to grand, life-changing endeavors, reflecting the gravity of the cleric's transgression.<br><br>
        Dungeon Masters are encouraged to use this table as a source of inspiration, rolling randomly or selecting entries that best fit the context of the campaign. Feel free to modify the results, adjust time frames, or tailor the tasks to align with the cleric’s deity, faith, and the overall narrative of the game. Acts of Contrition can serve as a meaningful way to deepen roleplaying opportunities, create compelling side quests, or explore the faith and devotion of a character.
