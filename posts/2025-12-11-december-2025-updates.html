        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>I know some people have expressed interest in the Land of the Crown Fantasy Solo and I am going to get those up in 2026.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>I've had the flu for the past week or so, and it killed my voice, the video I did (Punisher Solo) I had to pause so many times because I THOUGHT I was better, but apparently not. I was still coughing and my throat got so dry, towards the end my voice was cracking.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Circling back to 1, I also need to nail down the rules set I want to use, I was originally going with BF, but decided against it. I play that with my regular group constantly and I am kind of burned out on it.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>End of the year is upon us, and work is busy as we bust butt to finish up projects and such, so I've been doing a bunch of Overtime. Luckily I've had the option to work from home during this time, as they feel end of year stuff gets done faster when people are at home. Who am I to argue? Plus I'll be celebrating Christmas with the folks and family, so gaming will be taking a backseat. Family is important to me.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Video presentation: I also am trying to figure out what's better for me, using the desktop video and handwrite everything or use my PC with a Virtual Table Top. Personally I like the VTT method better as my handwriting sucks and its also an easily step process for getting videos out. With the desktop, I have to use my phone, then send the video, convert it, then edit it.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Traveller. I've had a few people suggest I play Traveller, while I've played classic once or twice in the past, that was many years ago. I am also torn between using Classic or the new Mongoose one. Suggestions?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Western Solo. I love the Old West setting and I love Westerns, especially the Spaghetti Westerns, and I was thinking of doing one. Thoughts?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>I think I might do a video on my D8 Anywhere system I created like 8 years ago or so, and I use it for quick solo games. I think it would be fun to show folks how easy the game system can be. Interested?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Taco Casa is probably the best fast food Tacos a man can get, and sadly they are only here in Texas. Yall are missing out. ;)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>I am going to attempt another video this week or weekend, see how my voice holds out and if I am coughing.</p>
          </li>
