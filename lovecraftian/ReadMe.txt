Lovecraftian Oracle Generator

This project is a Lovecraftian Oracle Generator that provides various random results 
for Plot Hooks, Inspiration, Tome Effects, Senses (Color, Taste, Smell, Sound), 
and other elements typically used for generating inspiration in Lovecraftian role-playing games.

The generator works entirely offline, so you can use it locally without needing an 
internet connection once the files are set up. The project contains three essential files:

- index.html: The structure and layout of the web page.
- script.js: The logic and functionality behind generating random results.
- style.css: The styling and design that makes the generator visually appealing.

How to Use

1. Download the zip file, and unzip:
   - Ensure you have the following files in the same folder:
     - index.html
     - script.js
     - style.css
     - wallpaper.jpg

2. Make sure all files are placed in the same folder. The structure should look like this:

/your-folder/
│
├── index.html      # The main HTML file
├── script.js       # The JavaScript file that makes the generator work
├── style.css       # The CSS file that handles the styling
└── wallpaper.jpg   # The file handling the background image

     
3. Open the HTML File
   - Simply open (or double click) the index.html file in any modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
   - No internet connection is required after this step.

4. Interact with the Generator
   - Use the buttons to generate different random results:
     - Roll for Event: Will be used when you want to ask a question for a yes/no answer.
     - Generate Adventure: Provides a random adventure hook.
     - Generate Plot Hook: Offers a quick story seed.
     - Generate Inspiration: Gives an inspiring idea for your game.
     - Generate Tome Effect: Rolls for an effect from a mysterious tome.
     - Generate Random Clue: Helps with generating random clues.
     - Generate Senses: Randomly generates associated senses like color, taste, smell, and sound for a more immersive experience.

4. See the Results
   - Each result will be displayed in a box beneath the button area.
   - Each result is formatted clearly to help you immediately apply it to your session or game.

5. Clear Results
   - Use the Clear Results button to reset the displayed results.

6. Wallpaper
   - the wallpaper used is an AI generated image as a place holder, if you want to replace it with something of your liking. Just delete the "wallpaper.jpg" and relace it with your favorite image, renaming wallpaper.jpg. Make sure its a JPG or it will not work.

Technical Information

- HTML: The structure of the webpage, including buttons for generating results, 
  input fields, and display areas for results.
- CSS: Custom styles for each element, including buttons, result containers, and inputs.
- JavaScript: Contains the logic for random generation. It pulls results from pre-defined 
  arrays (for example, tomeEffects, quests, and plotHooks) and displays them in a clean format.
